    The emergence of platforms like Six Degrees in the late 1990s paved the way for modern social networking. 
    However, it was Friendster, launched in 2002, that popularized the concept. Subsequently, platforms like MySpace, LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter contributed to the explosive growth of social media.</p>
